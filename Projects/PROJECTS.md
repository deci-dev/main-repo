1. Odd or Even?

2. Nexus Calculator **ON PROGRESS**

## Odd or Even? - *COMPLETED*

This is actually a stupid one. Maybe, just maybe you ask yourself, "Is 9999999 Odd or Even?" Well, surprise surprise, it's odd. (I mean, you could just check whether can you divide it by two or not. And yes, this is a stupid project.)

## Nexus Calculator - *ON PROGRESS*

I basically challenged myself to build a calculator Web App and did so. Although it has a lot of things I did wrong. (Errors and bugs.) Project is still **ON PROGRESS**
